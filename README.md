# JPEGatherer - Looking for JPEG's

Run jpegatherer_runner.py to see what your odds of getting those jpeg's are

----

JPEGatherer is to be utilized as a means to figure out when a high rarity unit in a gacha game is to be acquired. There's no guarantee that a user is able to replicate their successes from running a summon simulator, but the rarity type is something that is somewhat replicable. With this in mind, JPEGatherer only cares about what the odds of attaining the highest rarity unit is and what is roughly the time in which they will be pulled. Like previously stated, this program can only somewhat replicate a user's success.

**As such there is no guarantee that results will be 1:1, but it does provide insight as to a user's odds of success.**
